  <h2>Spatial temporal analysis of moving polygons in R.</h2>
<br>
<p>The stampr package was developed to provide a set of tools for performing polygon movement analysis that would be easily accessed by researchers across a wide-range of disciplines through the statistical software R. R now provides a number of more advanced spatial analysis packages and we see the stampr package as contributing to this work. Please see the paper by <a href='http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10109-007-0044-2'>Robertson et al. (2007)</a> for more information on the STAMP analysis framework.</p>

<p>The goal of this website is to provide access to the stampr tools which I have developed along with C. Robertson. I hope that other researchers will find the stampr package useful in their own research applications. I appreciate any and all feedback you may have concerning the stampr package.</p>

<p>Should you have any further questions please contact me via email: jed.long AT st-andrews.ac.uk </p>
<br><br>

<h2>Download stampr</h2>

<p>The stampr package is currently in development, but you can download the latest version of the source code which can then be loaded into R from your local machine. <a href='downloads/stampr_0.1.tar.gz'>DOWNLOAD</a></p>

<p>Also, be sure to check out the <a href='downloads/stampr-documentation.pdf'>documentation</a> associated with the stampr package for more detailed instructions. I will hopefully have a vignette available soon.</p>

<br>
<h3>Additional Information</h3>

<p>The stampr package has been developed for use within the statistical software R. The functions rely heavily on the data structures and methods developed in the <a href='http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/'>sp</a> and <a href='http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgeos/'>rgeos</a> spatial packages and I would like to thank the authors/contributors to these packages for all the work they have done facilitating spatial data analysis in R.</p>
