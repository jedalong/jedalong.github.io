  <h3>Spatial temporal analysis of moving polygons in R.</h3>
<br>
The stampr package was developed to provide a set of tools for performing polygon movement analysis that would be easily accessed by researchers across a wide-range of disciplines through the statistical software R. R now provides a number of more advanced spatial analysis packages and we see the stampr package as contributing to this work. Please see the paper by <a href='http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10109-007-0044-2'>Robertson et al. (2007)</a> for more information on the STAMP analysis framework.
  <br>
  <br>
The goal of this website is to provide access to the stampr tools which I have developed along with C. Robertson. I hope that other researchers will find the stampr package useful in their own research applications. I appreciate any and all feedback you may have concerning the stampr package.
<br><br>
Should you have any further questions please contact me via email: jed.long AT st-andrews.ac.uk

<a href='####'><h2>Download stampr</h2></a>
<br>
The stampr package is currently in development, but you can download the latest version of the source code which can then be loaded into R from your local machine. <a href='####'>DOWNLOAD</a> 
<br><br>
Also, be sure to check out the <a href='####'>documentation</a> and <a href='####'vignette</a> files associated with the stampr package for more detailed instructions.
<br><br>
<h3>Additional Information</h3>
<br>
The stampr package has been developed for use within the statistical software R. The functions rely heavily on the data structures and methods developed in the sp an rgeos spatial packages and I would like to thank the authors/contributors to these packages for all the work they have done facilitating spatial data analysis in R.
