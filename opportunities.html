  <h3>Spatial-temporal interactions in wildlife: The role of the landscape</h3>
  <p> Dr Long is seeking a PhD student who is interested in using GIS and spatial analysis to study spatial-temporal interactions in wildlife using data collected via GPS tracking collars. Of special interest is the study of how landscape features (e.g., habitat, roads, barriers) influence the emergence of interactive behaviour in wildlife, considering both inter- and intra-species interactions. Empirical GPS data will come from collaboration between Dr Long and the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, who have extensive GPS tracking data on white-tailed deer in the United States. This project is applicable to any student interested jointly in wildlife conservation and spatial ecology. Students with previous expertise in GIS, spatial analysis, statistics, and/or experience in computer programming (e.g., Python, R) will be highly desirable. </p><br><br>
  
  <h3>New Cartographic Principles for Movement Data</h3>
  <p> Recent technological advances have resulted in numerous applications for studying movement trajectories of people, their vehicles and wildlife. Movement data are now increasingly enriched with contextual information about the object or the environment within which they move. While methods for analysing and visualizing movement trajectories continue to improve, basic cartographic principles for generating movement data maps are lacking. This project will involve the development and testing of new cartographic methods for mapping complex movement datasets in order to effectively relay the information content of movement data and analysis. Specifically, focused will be placed on developing static 2-dimensional maps, whereas currently much emphasis is being placed on interactive visualizations. Students with a keen interest in cartography are highly encouraged to apply, and those with existing skills in GIS and computer programming are especially desirable. <br><i>with Dr Urska Demsar</i></p><br><br>
  
  <h3>Landscape level assessment of Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) reintroduction in Scotland: Socio-economic impacts and ecosystem services trade offs</h3>
  <p>The Eurasian beaver is a former native mammal that became extinct from Scotland largely through hunting pressure, almost 400 years ago. Its reintroduction has been proposed and debated over at least the last 30 years. At present it will be important to assess its impacts and socio-economic implications. This project will utilize high resolution remote sensing (e.g., SPOT satellite, Sentinel-2), in addition to the Land use information for Scotland to analyse impacts of beaver reintroduction in Scotland in the context of socio-economic impacts and ecosystem services. Specifically, this project will use temporal remote sensing and quantitative landscape level indicators to measure the influence of beaver distribution, including changes in forest characteristics and structure, assess changes in river variation, flooding, and derived impacts on habitat features, structural and functional connectivity and impacts on biodiversity.  Further, this project will spatially model potential conflicts and impacts to land-owners and measure ecosystem services and trade-offs related to beaver reintroductions at a regional scale. A potential extension will be a comparison study with an invasive beaver population in southern Patagonia, through ongoing collaboration with Argentinian researchers at  CADIC (CONICET, National Research Council) (Centro Austral de Investigaciones Cient??ficas). This will help to assess the effect of the introduced vs native species and their landscape impacts. Collaboration is also expected with the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland and with James Hutton Institute. Interested students with existing skills in remote sensing and GIS are encouraged. <br> <i>with Dr Sandra Luque</i></p><br><br>
