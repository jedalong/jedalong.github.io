Currently, I focus largely on the development of quantitative methods for exploring spatial patterns movement data, e.g., data obtained through GPS tracking. I also remain active in other research areas relating more broadly to GIScience; including spatial modelling, volunteered geographic information (and other non-traditional datasets), and map comparison. Finally, as a huge sports fan, I am fascinated by ways spatial data and analysis can be used in sports analytics.\r\n* Spatial ecology & landscape analysis\r\n  * Forest fragmentation\r\n  * Landscape pattern analysis\r\n  * Land-use / land cover change\r\n* Wildlife movement ecology & management\r\n  * Habitat mapping\r\n  * Home range analysis\r\n  * Inter- and Intra-species interactions\r\n  * Barriers, constraints, & connectivity\r\n* Time geography: theory & applications\r\n  * Human mobility patterns\r\n  * Accessibility\r\n  * Object kinetics\r\n* Space-time modelling \r\n  * Ecological invasions\r\n  * Disease spread\r\n  * Spatial uncertainty measures\r\n  * Map comparison\r\n* Sports analytics\r\n  * Tracking\r\n  * Mapping\r\n  * Visualization\r\n\r\n## Biography\r\nI hold a BSc in Physical Science from the University of Guelph, Canada, an Advanced Diploma in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) from the Centre of Geographic Sciences, Canada, and an MSc and PhD in Geography from the University of Victoria, Canada as part of the Spatial Pattern and Analysis lab. I have been a Lecturer in the Department of Geography and Sustainable Development at the University of St Andrews since September 2013. As a result, I am hopeful my golf handicap will soon improve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
